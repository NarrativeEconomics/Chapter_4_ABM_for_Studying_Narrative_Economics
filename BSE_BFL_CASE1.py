# BSE is a very simple simulation of automated execution traders
# operating on a very simple model of a limit order book (LOB) exchange's matching engine.
#
# major simplifications in this version:
#       (a) only one financial instrument being traded
#       (b) traders can only trade contracts of size 1
#       (c) each trader can have max of one order per single orderbook.
#       (d) traders can replace/overwrite earlier orders, and/or can cancel, with no fee/penalty imposed for doing so
#       (d) simply processes each order in sequence and republishes LOB to all traders
#           => no issues with exchange processing latency/delays or simultaneously issued orders.
#
# NB this code has been written to be readable/intelligible, not efficient!
